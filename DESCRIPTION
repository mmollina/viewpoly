Description: This package is for visualizing and exploring results from polyploid 
         computational tools using an interactive graphical user interface. The package 
         allows users to directly upload output files from polyploid tools, and genomic 
         assembly and annotation files. ViewPoly displays the SNP dosages in parentals and offspring, and their 
         respective haplotypes in the genetic map. It also shows the results of QTL analysis, 
         including confidence intervals, estimated effects, and their corresponding genomic 
         positions, which can be interactively explored with a genome browser, allowing the 
         search for candidate genes. It also provides features to download specific information 
         into comprehensive tables for further analysis and presentation.
